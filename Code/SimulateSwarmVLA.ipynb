        "    **What is Byzantine Consensus?**\n",
        "    - A fault-tolerant agreement protocol that works even when some agents are compromised (Byzantine)\n",
        "    - Based on the Byzantine Generals Problem by Lamport et al. (1982)\n",
        "    - Requires at least 2f+1 agents for f Byzantine agents\n",
        "\n",
        "    **SwarmVLA-Edge Configuration:**\n",
        "    - 50 total agents (distributed disaster detection nodes)\n",
        "    - 16 Byzantine agents maximum (32% fault tolerance)\n",
        "    - 34 honest agents (malicious-resistant majority)\n",
        "    - 4-round consensus protocol\n",
